## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Developing an app can be both thrilling and challenging. I encountered several barriers along the way, but prioritizing things, managing time wisely, and seeking advice from mentors all helped a great deal. Ensuring that the app works on many devices and screen sizes can be difficult, especially with limited testing tools, but testing the app on numerous devices, soliciting input from peers, and adhering to basic responsive design principles can help. Identifying and correcting defects can be time-consuming and stressful, especially when learning the ropes of testing; nevertheless, Adopt a test-driven development (TDD) methodology, employ debugging tools, and don't be afraid to seek assistance from classmates or peers. Building this software entailed accepting the learning curve, receiving help when necessary, and constantly adapting to new difficulties. Each obstacle presents an opportunity to learn and improve coding abilities.
